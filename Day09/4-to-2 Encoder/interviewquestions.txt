Interview Questions (with quick preparation notes)
Q1. What is an encoder?
Converts multiple input lines into binary output code.

Q2. Difference between encoder and decoder?
Encoder: Inputs → Binary code.
Decoder: Binary code → Activates corresponding output line.

Q3. Why do we need a priority encoder?
To handle cases when multiple inputs are high by giving priority to the highest order input.

Q4. Write the truth table for a 4-to-2 encoder.
(Prepare the above truth table quickly.)

Q5. What is the output if no input is high in a 4-to-2 encoder?
Output is invalid/undefined unless specifically designed to output a default code.

Q6. Where is an encoder used in real life?
Keyboard circuits, interrupt handling, data compression, communication systems.

Q7. How is a 4-to-2 encoder implemented using gates?
Using OR gates as per derived equations for outputs.

Q8. Can we use an encoder for decimal to BCD conversion?
Yes, decimal inputs (0-9) can be encoded into 4-bit BCD output.
