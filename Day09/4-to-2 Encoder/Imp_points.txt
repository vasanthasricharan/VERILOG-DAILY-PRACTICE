Most Important Points â€“ 4-to-2 Encoder
1. Definition:
An encoder converts 2^n input lines to n output lines, encoding the position of the active input into binary form.

2. 4-to-2 Encoder Inputs and Outputs:

Inputs: 4 lines (I0, I1, I2, I3)

Outputs: 2 lines (Y1, Y0) representing binary code of active input.

3. Truth Table:

Input	Output
0001	00
0010	01
0100	10
1000	11
Others (multiple inputs or none)	undefined / invalid

4. Limitation:
Standard encoder does not handle multiple inputs being high simultaneously. It outputs invalid or undefined logic.

5. Priority Encoder:
To handle multiple active inputs, a priority encoder is used, which outputs the highest priority active input.

6. Application:
Used in keyboard encoding, interrupt request encoding, data compression, and digital systems to minimize wiring.

7. Equation:
For a 4-to-2 encoder,

Y1 = I2 + I3

Y0 = I1 + I3

(This is for logic design; behavioral design often uses case statements.)

8. Implementation:
Implemented using logic gates, multiplexers, or behavioral Verilog code.
