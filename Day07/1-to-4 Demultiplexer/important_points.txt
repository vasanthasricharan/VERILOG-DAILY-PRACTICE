Core Conceptual Points

Definition:
A 1-to-4 demultiplexer takes 1 input and routes it to one of 4 outputs based on 2 select lines.
Number of select lines:
For n outputs, log₂n select lines are required.
Here, 4 outputs → 2 select lines (00, 01, 10, 11).

Truth Table:

sel1	sel0	Y0	Y1	Y2	Y3
0	    0	    I	0	0	0
0	    1	    0	I	0	0
1	    0	    0	0	I	0
1	    1	    0	0	0	I

I = input value

Basic use cases:
Data routing to multiple devices.
Serial to parallel conversion.
Address decoding in memory to enable a specific block.
