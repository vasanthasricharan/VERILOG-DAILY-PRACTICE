Important Interview Points

1. Difference between mux and demux
Mux: Multiple inputs → Single output. (Selector selects input)
Demux: Single input → Multiple outputs. (Selector selects output line)

2. Application-based questions
“How is demux used in memory interfacing?”
➔ Used as a decoder to enable one memory block at a time based on address lines.

3. Implementation in Verilog
Describe always @(*) combinational block.
Use case statement or assign statements with continuous assignments for structural style.

4. Difference between decoder and demux
Decoder has no data input, only decoding outputs based on select lines.
Demux has data input routed to selected output.
Practically, demux = decoder + enable/data input.

5. Real-time applications
Data distribution to peripherals.
Switching communication lines in time-division multiplexing systems.
Controlled LED lighting patterns or device enable signals.
