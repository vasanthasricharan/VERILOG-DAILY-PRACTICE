✅ Important Points about D Latch
Feature	Description
Full Name	Data Latch or Transparent Latch
Type	Level-sensitive (not edge-triggered)
Inputs	D (Data), E (Enable or Clock)
Outputs	Q, Q̅ (Qbar)
Behavior	- When E=1: Q = D (transparent)
- When E=0: Q holds previous value
Use Case	Temporary data storage, latch-based FSMs, low-power designs
Level Sensitivity	Sensitive to level of clock (Enable) not edge
Built From	SR latch + logic to avoid invalid state
Problem Solved	Eliminates the invalid condition of SR latch (S=R=1)
Not Edge-Triggered	Can lead to glitches if not carefully controlled
Synchronous or Asynchronous?	Generally used in asynchronous or level-sensitive systems
Glitch Risk	Yes, if E (enable) is not clean or has bouncing edges
