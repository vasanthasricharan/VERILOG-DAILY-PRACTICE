‚úÖ Important Points on JK Flip-Flop
Edge-Triggered Device

Usually triggered on positive or negative edge of the clock.

Inputs:

J: Set input

K: Reset input

Output:

Q and Q' (complement of Q)

Characteristic Table:

J	K	Q(next)	Description
0	0	Q	No change
0	1	0	Reset
1	0	1	Set
1	1	~Q	Toggle (complement)

Race Around Condition:

Occurs when both J = 1 and K = 1 and the clock pulse is high long enough for Q to toggle more than once.

Resolved using edge triggering or Master-Slave configuration.

Applications:

Counters (e.g., ripple counter)

Registers

Frequency division

Memory elements

Comparison with Other Flip-Flops:

RS: Unstable for R=S=1

D: Single input; simpler

T: Toggle flip-flop, derived from JK (J=K=1)


üìù Quick Revision Tip
Characteristic Equation:
                        Qnext = JQbar + KbarQ
This tells how the next state depends on J, K, and the current state.
