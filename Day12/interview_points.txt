ðŸ’¡ Common Interview Questions
âœ… Q1. What is a decoder?

A combinational circuit that converts binary information from â€˜nâ€™ input lines to a maximum of 2^n unique output lines.

âœ… Q2. How many outputs will a 3-to-8 decoder have?

8 outputs (since 2^3 = 8).

âœ… Q3. Why is an enable input used in decoders?

To control when the decoder is active. It allows multiple decoders to be connected in hierarchical designs without output conflicts.

âœ… Q4. How can you implement a 3-to-8 decoder using two 2-to-4 decoders?

Use one input as enable for the two 2-to-4 decoders.

Use remaining two inputs as actual inputs to both decoders.

Connect the third input to enable one decoder at a time, effectively expanding from 2-to-4 to 3-to-8.

âœ… Q5. What is the difference between decoder and demultiplexer?

Decoder: Converts binary input to a one-hot output.

Demultiplexer: Routes a single data input to one of many outputs based on select lines. Functionally similar but differs in usage context (data distribution vs code conversion).

âœ… Q6. Can a decoder be used as a demultiplexer?

Yes, by adding a data input line as an AND gate input to each output.

âœ… Q7. Draw the logic diagram for a 3-to-8 decoder.

(Prepare its diagram with three inputs (A,B,C), eight AND gates each receiving specific combinations with enable.)

âœ… Q8. Where are decoders used in microprocessors?

In instruction decoding and address decoding for selecting memory locations or I/O devices.
