ðŸ“Œ Important Points (Conceptual)
Definition: A 3-to-8 decoder has 3 input lines and 8 output lines. It activates one output corresponding to the binary value of the inputs when enabled.

Enable Input: Often included to control whether the decoder is active; when disabled, all outputs remain zero (or inactive).

Output Behavior:

If input is n, output n is high (1) and all others are low (0).

Active high vs active low outputs based on design requirements.

Equation-Based Realization: Each output is a minterm function of inputs and enable:

For example, Y0 = ~A * ~B * ~C * En

Applications:

Memory address decoding

Data demultiplexing

Instruction decoding in CPUs

General Formula:

An n-to-2^n decoder has n inputs and 2^n outputs.

Implementation:

Constructed using AND gates and NOT gates for each minterm.
