ðŸ”¹ Definition
A multiplexer (MUX) selects one input from multiple data inputs and forwards it to a single output line.

8-to-1 MUX has:

8 data inputs: D0 to D7

3 select lines: S2, S1, S0

1 output: Y

ðŸ”¹ Function
Based on the 3-bit select input, one of the 8 inputs is connected to the output:

Example: if S = 3'b010, then Y = D2

ðŸ”¹ Truth Table (Simplified)
S2 S1 S0	Y
0  0  0     D0
0  0  1	    D1
0  1  0	    D2
0  1  1	    D3
1  0  0	    D4
1  0  1	    D5
1  1  0	    D6
1  1  1	    D7

ðŸ”¹ Applications
Data routing and selection

Implementing logic functions

Communication systems and ALUs

Control units in CPUs

ðŸ”¹ Verilog Design Tip
Can be implemented using:

Ternary operators (compact)

case statements (more readable)

Hierarchical design (using 2-to-1 muxes)

ðŸ”¹ Formula
Number of select lines = logâ‚‚(N)

For 8 inputs â†’ logâ‚‚(8) = 3 select lines

ðŸ”¹ Common Interview Questions
How many select lines does an 8:1 MUX need? â†’ 3

Can you design a 4:1 MUX using 2:1 MUXes?

Use an 8:1 MUX to implement logic functions (like majority or parity)
