✅ Important Points – 4-bit Comparator
1) Definition
A 4-bit comparator compares two 4-bit binary numbers and determines their relative magnitude (greater, less, equal).

2) Inputs and Outputs

Inputs: Two 4-bit numbers (A[3:0], B[3:0])

Outputs:

gt (A > B)

lt (A < B)

eq (A == B)

3) Logic Approach

Compare MSB first (bit 3).

If equal, check next lower bits (bit 2, bit 1, bit 0) sequentially.

First non-equal bit determines the result.

4) Number of Combinations

16 (A) x 16 (B) = 256 possible input combinations.

5) Design Styles

Behavioral design using if-else conditions.

Structural design using gate-level implementation:

XOR, AND, OR gates for equality and comparison logic.

6) Cascading Comparators

For >4-bit comparisons (8-bit, 16-bit), cascade smaller comparators using greater than, less than, equal inputs and outputs.

7) Applications

Processors for data comparison

Sorting circuits

Address decoding in memory

Control logic decision making
