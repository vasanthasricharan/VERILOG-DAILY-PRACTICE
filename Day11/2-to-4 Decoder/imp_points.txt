‚≠ê Important Points (2-to-4 Decoder)
Definition:
A 2-to-4 decoder converts 2 input lines to 4 unique outputs, with only one output active at a time, depending on input combination.

Inputs & Outputs:

Inputs: 2 selection lines (in[1:0]) + optional enable input

Outputs: 4 outputs, each representing one minterm.

Enable Signal Function:
When enable (en) is 0, all outputs are deactivated (logic 0). When en is 1, the decoder operates normally.

Logic Equation:
For outputs Y0 to Y3:

Y0 = ~in[1] & ~in[0] & en

Y1 = ~in[1] & in[0] & en

Y2 = in[1] & ~in[0] & en

Y3 = in[1] & in[0] & en

Applications:

Memory address decoding

Instruction decoding

Peripheral selection in microprocessor systems

Implementation Types:

Behavioral (using case)

Structural (using AND, NOT, and enable gates)

Expansion:
Larger decoders can be built using smaller decoders with enable inputs (e.g. 3-to-8 decoder using two 2-to-4 decoders).

Difference from Demultiplexer:
A decoder converts binary input to unique outputs; a demux routes a data input to one of the outputs based on select lines.
