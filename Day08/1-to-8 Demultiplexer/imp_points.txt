🔷 1-to-8 Demultiplexer – Important Points
✅ Definition:
A demultiplexer routes a single input to one of many outputs, based on select lines. It acts like a single-pole multi-throw switch in digital circuits.

✅ Inputs & Outputs:

Inputs:

Data input (D): 1 bit

Select lines (S2 S1 S0): 3 bits to select 1 out of 8 outputs

Outputs:

8 outputs (Y0 to Y7), only one is active at a time.

✅ Applications:

Data routing

Memory address decoding

Serial to parallel data conversion

Enabling multiple devices from a single data line

✅ Enable pin (in general demux ICs):

Controls overall functionality (e.g. 74138 has active low enable pins)

✅ Equation:
For output Y[i],
𝑌
[
𝑖
]
=
𝐷
⋅
(
select condition for i
)
Y[i]=D⋅(select condition for i)

✅ IC Example:

74LS138 is a 3-to-8 decoder but can function as 1-to-8 demux by connecting data input to enable pins appropriately.

✅ Difference from Decoder:

Decoder	Demux
No data input, only select inputs	Has data input + select lines
Activates output line based on select lines	Routes data input to selected output
