🔷 Interview Questions (Direct & Conceptual)
✔️ Q1. What is a demultiplexer?
A circuit that routes a single input to one of several outputs based on select lines.

✔️ Q2. How many select lines are required for 1-to-8 demux?
3 select lines (since 
2
3
=
8
2 
3
 =8).

✔️ Q3. Difference between decoder and demux?
Decoder has no data input; demux has data input and selection lines to route data.

✔️ Q4. Can you implement a demux using decoder?
Yes, by connecting the data input to enable pins of the decoder (if decoder has enable).

✔️ Q5. What is the practical application of demux in communication?
Serial to parallel data conversion or distributing a single communication line to multiple destinations.

✔️ Q6. Draw a block diagram for 1-to-8 demux.
(Practice drawing input D, select lines S2,S1,S0, outputs Y0-Y7 with arrow routed accordingly).

✔️ Q7. Write Verilog code for 1-to-8 demux.
Refer to the design code I gave you earlier today.

✔️ Q8. What happens if enable is low (in general demux ICs)?
All outputs are disabled (high impedance or logic high/low depending on IC).

✔️ Q9. How to implement a 1-to-8 demux using 1-to-4 demux?
Cascade two 1-to-4 demux: first controls enable of two second-stage demux.

✔️ Q10. What is the truth table of 1-to-8 demux?
(Practice writing: for each combination of select lines, only the corresponding output = D).
