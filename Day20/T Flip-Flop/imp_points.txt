✅ Important Interview Points on D Flip-Flop
Definition:

A D (Data or Delay) Flip-Flop captures the value of the input D at the rising or falling edge of the clock and outputs it as Q.

Basic Equation:

Q(next) = D at the triggering clock edge.

Edge Sensitivity:

Flip-flops are edge-triggered (positive or negative edge), unlike latches which are level-sensitive.

Reset Type:

Can have asynchronous or synchronous resets.

Asynchronous: Immediate reset (not dependent on clock).

Synchronous: Reset on clock edge.

Applications:

Registers, pipelines, counters, memory elements, state machines.

Metastability:

If input D changes close to clock edge → undefined output for a short time.

Hold and Setup Time:

Setup time: Minimum time D should be stable before the clock edge.

Hold time: Minimum time D should remain stable after the clock edge.

Difference from Latch:

Flip-flop: Edge-triggered.

Latch: Level-sensitive.

Timing Diagram Understanding:

Be able to draw and analyze timing diagrams showing clk, D, and Q.

Power and Area:

Flip-flops consume more power than latches due to edge detection logic.
