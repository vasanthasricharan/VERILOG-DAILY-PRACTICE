How do you handle the condition when no input is active in an encoder design?

‚úÖ Advanced

How would you design a generic N-to-log2(N) priority encoder using generate loops?

What are the timing implications of a wide (e.g. 32-to-5) priority encoder on a high-speed design?

How can you implement a priority encoder using structural design with gates only?

‚úÖ Application-based
