⭐ 📌 Important Points
Definition:
A priority encoder outputs the binary representation of the highest-priority active input. It resolves conflicts when multiple inputs are high.

Priority Mechanism:

The highest numbered input has priority in standard designs (e.g. input[7] over input[0] in 8-to-3 encoder).

Priority can be MSB-first or LSB-first based on design specification.

Output Bits:

For N inputs, it produces log2(N) bits at the output.

Valid Signal:
Often included to indicate if any input is active (valid=0 if no input is high).

casex/casez usage:

casex: treats ‘x’ and ‘z’ as don't care.

casez: treats only ‘z’ as don’t care.
Use them carefully to match intended priority conditions.

Difference from normal encoder:
An encoder assumes only one input is active, whereas a priority encoder handles multiple active inputs and resolves based on priority.

Applications:

Interrupt controllers (resolving highest priority interrupt request)

Bus arbitration

Multiplexed data decoding

Synthesis considerations:
Encoders are synthesizable but may infer large combinational priority logic for wide inputs, impacting timing.

Hazards:
Ensure inputs are stable during encoding to avoid glitches in outputs.
